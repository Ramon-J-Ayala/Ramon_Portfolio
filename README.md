## The Adventure Ahead of You

I wanted to get into graphic design to create pieces that fans of multiple seires could enjoy and love just as much as I love the series. I hope to create my own series one day to bring joy to people just like how some series did to me. What the series will be entertainment wise and what it would be about is still undetermined but that is my end goal in life and i can make something small turn into something big over time.
